I wanted to document the process of building this website. I didn't just sit down and start writing raw HTML. Do people even do that any more?
</p>

<p>
When I work on projects, I already prefer to write up the code, document, or Jupyter notebook as if I am telling a story. This helps me better understand that concepts I am covering, makes me write more clearly and explain to myself what I did when I inevitably revisit a notebook. If that's how I write, why not try to turn all of that into a personal website, project portfolio, and learning space for web development skills?
</p>

<p>
My goal was to take the stuff I was already doing and turn it into a website, and thankfully, that isn't too difficult!

I'm building this website slowly and incrementally making changes to it in balance with wanting to work on other projects. I still want to document those incremental changes (when the increment or sum of smaller increments warrants it) here.
